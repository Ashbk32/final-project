    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Chickpea pasta I used <a href="https://www.explorecuisine.com/en/chickpea-pasta-fusilli.html">Organic Chickpea Fusilli</a></li>
        <li>Organic pasta sauce or you can make your own</li>
        <li>Siracha sauce to mix with pasta sauce or drizzle on top</li>
        <li>Avocado always!!!</li>
      </ul>
    <h1>Instructions</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Bring 6 cups of water to boil with lots of salt</li>
        <li>Once water boils add pasta and let cook, check you package to see how long it takes usually 7-9 mins. If you are cooking the pasta with meat or sauce, I generally would take it out at 7 mins</li>
        <li>Drain & Save pasta water to add into the sauce when it’s time to heat your sauce of choice up</li>
        <li>Break out the sauce and add any extra herb spices and a cup of pasta water.</li>
        <li> Before the sauce gains any real heat add you strained pasta in</li>
        <li>Let cook for a few minutes stirring and watching. Add basil or black pepper if you like</li>
        <li>Place in your favorite bowl add avocado like I did or whatever you like grated cheese, more basil</li>
        <li>Enjoy your food!!! Groove</li>
